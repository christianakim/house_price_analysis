# House Price Analysis
This is my second capstone project for Thinkful.

Scenario: I'm working as an analyst at an investment bank. The team that I am working with wants to understand how it should allocate dollars earmarked for investment into mortgage-backed securities. They've asked me to look into factors that drive home prices.

Project Deliverables:
1. An Excel workbook containing house price data and my statistical analysis.
2. A PowerPoint deck where I share my findings from my research.
3. A live presentation where I deliver my findings and recommendations with the investment team.

Demonstrated Tools & Techniques:
